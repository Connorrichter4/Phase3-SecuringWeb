# Implement Spring Security with Authentication

## Project Description

As a developer, build Authentication Provider in Spring Security.

You have been assigned a task by the team to add more flexibility rather than using the standard scenario in building Spring Security.

## Technologies Used

- Eclipse as the IDE
- Apache Tomcat as the web server
- Spring MVC
- JSP or Thymeleaf
- Spring Security

## Requirements

- You should have a spring MVC web application as part of your submission. (JSP or Thymeleaf are both acceptable front-ends)
- User Password style in-memory storage is acceptable but variations on this (such as storing to database) are also acceptable.
- Users should be redirected to a login.html page if not authenticated before being redirected to the original page once authenticated.
- A few of the source code should be tracked on GitHub repositories. You need to document the tracked files which are ignored during the final push to the GitHub repository.
- The submission of your GitHub repository link is mandatory. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository in the document.
- The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented.
